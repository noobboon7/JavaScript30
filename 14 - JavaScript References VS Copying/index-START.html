    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[0] = "jerry"
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team4 = players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players[1] = 'elon';
    console.log(players, team2, team3);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    console.log(captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 20 });
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person, number: 99, age: 20 };
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    console.log(cap2, cap3);

    const cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
